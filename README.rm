What is Colonoscopy?
  An application that was produced to aid in the extraction of useful information from the publically released
  Collection dumps. These dumps were compiled in a way that makes any single query useless and missing vital
  information based on patterns or other techniques.Colonoscopy goes deep into the dumps and attemtps to extract 
  potential and known Username:Password credential pairs.
  
  The application will not unzip any of the contents and will require the user to perform some actions (or script) that
  will generate a monolithic file from these .txt files. These files will contian different versions of these credential
  pairs which can be a daungting task to extract from common methods.

  The application will do its best to ensure these files are as true and uncontaminated as possible. Users may have to 
  ensure the filters have properly worked by examining the output for errors. These files will be contaioned in the 'evidence' 
  directory and a project name will be assertained from the filename.

How to use Colonoscopy?
  This is a OS independent Commandline application. This application should be used on the OS where the files are located. The
  Files can be attached VIA NAS or other technology, as long as Read/Writer permissions are granted to the executing user.

Example of monolythic list generation?
  ex: tar -zxvf SomeCollection.gz; cat ./SomeCollection/*.txt >>./Somecollection.txt

Example of execution?
  ex:  colonoscopy.rb ./SomeCollection/Somecollection.txt

      ./evidence/
            |
            | --./Somecollection/
            |       |
            |       | --./cleaned.txt
            |       | --./colon.txt
            |       | --./semi.txt
            |       | --./unknown.txt
            |       | --./blaw.etc
            |
            | --./SomeOthercollection/
            |       | --.blaw.etc

:[ATTENTION]:
    [!] The application uses the input name to set a project folder in the 'evidence' directory
          [-] If you use the same name for the input folder as an existing project output, it will be overwritten
    [!] If you add a second argument to the command, diagnostic output will be given
          [-] This will decrease the applicaitons performance dramtically, be forewarned.
:[ATTENTION]:
 
Any additional updates may include automation and additional filters if needed or provided by community support.
