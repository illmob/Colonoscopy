  We encourage people to report bug and other exceptions within the application as they arrise.
  We will look at the reported issue and identify if PEBKAC or other ID10T errors have taken place. We are not perfect, no one is.
  Additionally, users who are interested in contribusting code patches and fixes are encouraged to do so through Git.
  
  The application is highly dependent on signatures, expansion can be submitting samples of datasets which you would like to see
  extracted and stored in a specific format. These will aid in others whom might be facing the same situation. Think about the kids!
